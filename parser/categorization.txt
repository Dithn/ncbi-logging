General
3 broad categories:
- accepted
    - full (accession, filename, extension extracted/recognized)
    - w/o accession
    - list or access to a file

- rejected with invalid field(s): some fields are invalid/suspect. Keep the source. 
Maybe only report the first bad field since a usual problem is extra or deleted tokens which
shifts the contents of the line

- unrecognized: failure to parse, report the source.

These 3 should probably go into separate output streams and have slightly different set of data per line.
