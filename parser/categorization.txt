General

Broad categories (each is a method on the API)

- good
    - full (accession - SRA only for now, filename, extension extracted/recognized)
    - list or access to a file (add to the event: did the accession come from a pre-parsed field or from the original request)
    - w/o accession

- suspect (failure to classify; suspected format change). Report the first offending field;
    annotate with the nature of offence. Mark other bad fields, maybe report the total.
    Attach the source line.

- garbage (recognized as garbage). Example: probing requests.

- unrecognized: failure to parse, report the source.

These should probably go into separate output streams and have slightly different set of data per line.
Make the summary Json as well.
