description of incremental updates to already loaded data
---------------------------------------------------------

step 1)
generate a patch-id
select a subset (or full set) of the rows in the database, and apply the patch-id to the subset
extract the subset in JSON-format

step 2)
transform the JSON-format from step 1 into the original input-format

step 3)
feed the original input-format into the format-specific parser

step 4)
load the resulting JSON back into the database, that includes adjusted/fixed values
the newly loaded data will have patch-id zero now

step 5)
delete the subset from step 1 from the database, be deleting rows with the generated patch-id

---------------------------------------------------------
we need to develop format-specific tools for step 2.

the format-specific parser for step 3 is the regular one for importing.
